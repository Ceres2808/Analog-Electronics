# Study of Op-Amp as a Differential Amplifier

## Objective
To study op-amp as a differential amplifier and observe its output at noisy signal common to both input terminals.

## Results and Comments
The measured and calculated values of \(V_{out}\) are approximately equal, with an average error of about 0.003V over six readings. \(V_{out} = V_1 - V_2\). Errors are due to noise, imperfect grounding, and resistor tolerance. When input voltages were made exactly the same, \(V_{out}\) was −0.002V, very close to the calculated value of 0, mainly due to resistance tolerance error[4].
