## Observations
- **At f = 10 kHz**
- **At f = 15 kHz**

## Results and Comments
The amplifier achieved good efficiency (>50%), consistent with theoretical predictions. The output signal had crossover distortions, typical for Class B designs. These findings highlight the Class B amplifier's effective power efficiency and inherent trade-offs in signal quality[3].
